        <h2>Designer and Developer</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          I’m Harriet, a Product Designer based in Irvine, California. I
          specialize in interaction design and prototyping. I obtained my
          bachelor’s degree in Cognitive Science, with a minor in Computer
          Science from University of California, San Diego in December 2019.
          Previously I interned at American Express to streamline digital
          workplace support experience. Currently I am looking for full-time
          opportunities in Product Design. <br />
          <br />
          As a Designer, I strongly believe in interdisciplinary design, as
          great digital experiences usually come from the intersection of
          research, graphic design, human psychology, data analytics and
          engineering.In my free time, I analyze and write about the cultural
          and technological foundation of classic and modern Science Fiction. I
          leave you here with my favorite quote from Star Trek: “Compassion:
          that's the one things no machine ever had. Maybe it's the one thing
          that keeps men ahead of them.”
